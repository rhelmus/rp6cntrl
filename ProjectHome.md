Personal project which focuses on interfacing the RP6 robot (from Arexx) with a small linux SBC (Fox board). The linux board communicates via serial with the M32 expansion board, which in turn communicates with the base robot via I2C (TWI). The linux board acts as a bridge between the robot and internet, so that the robot can be monitored and controlled through a TCP connection. The linux board also makes it possible to program the robot with the Lua scripting language. Currently Qt and ncurses frontends exist; the latter being present on the linux board itself and can be used through a ssh connection.
